In this project I created a map of the visual hierarchy of https://www.smashingmagazine.com/
The main elements of the page are represented as greyscale divs. The darker, the higher in the visual hierarchy. (This was a good opportunity to use CSS variables).
In a second step, I added text to the article-elements und tried to roughly recreate the typographic aspect of the site.
